This mini proyect uses Whisper of Open AI to transcribe audio files, (i recommend mp3), also i attempt to add a recording functionality
but i couldnÂ´t, so if you wanna try to implement it, there is the code with comments. 

For more information of how to use Whisper, visit this github: https://github.com/openai/whisper

The app uses the medium model of Whisper, but you can change it in self.Whisper atribute.
Check the github for what size of model you can use.
